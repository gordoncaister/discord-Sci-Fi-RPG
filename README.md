# discord-Sci-Fi-RPG

Supernova on the Rocks  (working name)
A discord SCI-FI RPG Game

Original Idea:
- Money/Currency
- Customizable Jobs we can assign to people
- Salary based on jobs
- Crafting based on which job you're assigned to (only a cook should be able to 'craft' a pie)
- Crafting that requires a recipe, including multiple items (ex: apple pie requires 5 apples, 1 sugar, 1 flour, 1 butter, 1 egg, and a pie tin)
- Customizable inventory system. I want to be able to add items, description, weight, its crafting recipe, etc.
- A general shop to sell/buy from
- A marketplace for player-based buying/selling/trading
- Weight-based inventory system
- Customizable missions. Not exactly sure about this one, but some kind of RPG elements where people can "do" them and find items/money. 
- Health, hungry, and thirst system
 
I'm sure I'm forgetting some things, but this is a base idea of the kind of bot I'm looking for. I don't see this being super easy, but I could be wrong haha
I found a bot that's very close to this, but its inventory system is a pain in the ass, and it has no legit RPG elements, leaving everything to your imagination
